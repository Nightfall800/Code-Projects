# 3D View Cube.
I wanted to contribute this example to raylib, but it was to long. 
It is a variant of the 3D rotation cube, which is usually found in CAD programs. It makes it easier to create and move in 3D. 
I have also made it so that you can "Add" cubes and "Move" cubes in 3D. It is a nice interface if you want to create a 3D editor, 
CAD program, etc. I've used raylib 5.5.

# First Person Shooter.
I'm making a wolfenstein-like game in 3D. 
Mostly because I want to try doing something like that and I think the technology behind it is interesting. 
But this one can be run in Windows. I've used raylib 5.0 to simplify the coding a bit.
