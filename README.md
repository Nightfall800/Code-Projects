# 3D View Cube.
I wanted to contribute this example to raylib, but it was to long. 
It is a variant of the 3D rotation cube, which is usually found in CAD programs. It makes it easier to create and move in 3D. 
I have also made it so that you can "Add" cubes and "Move" cubes in 3D. It is a nice interface if you want to create a 3D editor, 
CAD program, etc. Kind regards, Niklas Holmberg.
